I’m a Computer Science student passionate about **full-stack and mobile development**, with a strong focus on building **real-world applications** using modern technologies. I enjoy working across the entire stack — from clean, responsive user interfaces to scalable backends and cloud services — and I’m constantly learning new tools and best practices.
